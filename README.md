# WRClassification
Creating a CNN that can classify Wolf Rayet Nebulae based on their morphology

In TESTFITS.pynb, the fits files are converted into jpegs and then denoised using morphological transformations.
In CNNv2.pynb (run in colab), a CNN is trained on the images obtained previously.

More data is required to train the CNN. Also, I want to create a GAN that is able to search for WR nebulae without supervision.
